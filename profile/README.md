## ðŸš€ codeGROOVE

We're on a mission to help teams ship code faster, with an audacious goal of lowering the average push-to-merge time by 90%+ - with our first GitHub app going beta in November of 2025.

We're also big open-source nerds and actively sponsor GitHub projects we make use of, as well as host dozens of our own. Here's a few:

* (https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/goose)[Review Goose] - desktop app to notify you when there is code waiting for your review
* (https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/retry)[retry) - Simple battle-hardened retry library for Go.
* (https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/slacker)[slacker] - A smarter Slack notification bot for GitHub
