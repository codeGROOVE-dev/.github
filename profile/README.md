We're on a mission to help teams ship code faster, with an ambitious goal of lowering the pull request latency by 94% - our first GitHub app (Ready-to-Review) will go beta in November 2025.

We're big open-source nerds and actively sponsor GitHub projects we love, as well as host dozens of our own. Here are some:

* [Review Goose](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/goose) - desktop app to notify you when there is code waiting for your review
* [retry](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/retry) - Simple battle-hardened retry library for Go.
* [slacker](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/slacker) - A smarter Slack notification bot for GitHub
